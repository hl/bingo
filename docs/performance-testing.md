# Performance Testing Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for writing and maintaining performance tests in the Bingo codebase.

## Performance Testing Philosophy

Bingo's performance testing is designed around **realistic enterprise workloads** rather than theoretical maximums. Our approach focuses on:

- **Practical scalability**: Tests that represent real-world usage patterns
- **Sustainable performance**: Consistent performance across different hardware configurations
- **Actionable metrics**: Performance data that guides optimization decisions

## Current Performance Baseline

Based on comprehensive testing with individual test execution, the engine delivers:

### Verified Performance Results (Release Mode)

| Test Scenario | Facts | Rules | Time | Memory | Throughput |
|--------------|-------|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| Simple 100K | 100,000 | 1 | 69ms | ~100MB | 1.4M facts/sec |
| Simple 200K | 200,000 | 1 | 118ms | 265MB | 1.7M facts/sec |
| Simple 500K | 500,000 | 1 | 264ms | 596MB | 1.9M facts/sec |
| Simple 1M | 1,000,000 | 1 | 709ms | 1.3GB | 1.4M facts/sec |
| **Simple 2M** | **2,000,000** | **1** | **1.8s** | **3.2GB** | **1.1M facts/sec** |
| Payroll 100K | 100,000 | 4 | 99ms | 249MB | 1.0M facts/sec |
| Enterprise 250K | 250,000 | 200 | 1.0s | 430MB | 250K facts/sec |
| Enterprise 500K | 500,000 | 300 | 2.7s | 878MB | 185K facts/sec |
| Enterprise 1M | 1,000,000 | 400 | 1.3s | 2.8GB | 755K facts/sec |
| **Enterprise 2M** | **2,000,000** | **500** | **2.6s** | **5.5GB** | **756K facts/sec** |

### Core Operations (Release Mode)
- **Basic fact processing**: 1.1M-1.9M facts/sec (simple scenarios)
- **Enterprise processing**: 185K-755K facts/sec (complex rule sets)
- **Memory efficiency**: ~1.3KB per fact average overhead
- **Rule complexity**: Up to 500 business rules per dataset

### Production Targets (Validated)
- **100K facts**: <3 seconds processing time ✅ (69ms achieved)
- **200K facts**: <6 seconds processing time ✅ (118ms achieved)  
- **500K facts**: <10 seconds processing time ✅ (264ms achieved)
- **1M facts**: <30 seconds processing time ✅ (709ms achieved)
- **2M facts**: <60 seconds processing time ✅ (1.8s achieved)
- **Memory efficiency**: <3GB for 1M facts ✅ (1.3GB achieved)
- **Rule complexity**: 200+ business rules per dataset ✅ (500 rules tested)

## Guidelines for Adding New Performance Tests

When adding a new performance test, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Create a new test file:** Create a new test file in the appropriate `tests` directory.
2.  **Use the `#[ignore]` attribute:** Mark performance tests as ignored to separate them from unit tests.
3.  **Set realistic expectations:** Base performance targets on actual measurement data, not theoretical limits.
4.  **Add a warm-up phase:** If your test is sensitive to cold starts, add a warm-up phase.
5.  **Add a descriptive test name:** The test name should clearly describe what the test is measuring.
6.  **Add comments:** Add comments to your test to explain what it is doing and what the expected outcome is.

## Performance Test Categories

### Unit Performance Tests
- **Purpose**: Validate individual component performance
- **Execution**: Run with `--release` flag for accurate timing
- **Targets**: Component-specific performance requirements

### Integration Performance Tests  
- **Purpose**: Validate end-to-end system performance
- **Execution**: `cargo test --release -- --ignored`
- **Targets**: Realistic production scenarios

### Scaling Tests
- **Purpose**: Validate performance at different scales
- **Execution**: Manual execution for resource-intensive tests
- **Targets**: Enterprise-scale workloads

## Best Practices

- **Use the `#[ignore]` attribute:** All performance tests should be ignored to separate from unit tests.
- **Set realistic thresholds:** Performance tests should use achievable targets based on measurement data.
- **Add warm-up phases:** Performance tests should include a warm-up phase to ensure consistent measurements.
- **Test in release mode:** Always run performance tests with `--release` flag for accurate results.
- **Document expectations:** Include performance targets and rationale in test comments.
