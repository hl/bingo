## ðŸ”§ Production Readiness CLI Tools

Use the following CLI commands to validate production readiness:

```bash
# Run comprehensive production readiness check
./scripts/start-production.sh --check-only

# Generate production readiness report
cargo run --bin bingo-production validate --output production-readiness-report.md

# Check current configuration
cargo run --bin bingo-production show --format yaml

# Generate configuration template
cargo run --bin bingo-production config --output production-config.yaml

# Run health check
cargo run --bin bingo-production health --endpoint localhost:50051
```
