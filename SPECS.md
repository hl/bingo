3. **Memory Abstraction**: FactStore trait enables optimization without algorithm changes
4. **Simplified Architecture**: Two rule types (built-in + JSON with calculator DSL)
5. **Private Network**: Simplified safety model focused on preventing accidents
6. **Incremental Features**: Add JSON rules and calculator DSL only after core validation

## Testing Architecture (IMPLEMENTED ✅)

### Quality vs Performance Test Separation

**Quality Test Suite (Fast & Reliable - ZERO Tolerance):**
- **189+ tests** across all packages executing in <60 seconds
- **Zero tolerance** for failures - all tests must pass
- **CI/CD ready** with fast feedback loops
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, API validation

**Performance Test Suite (Enterprise Validation):**
- **16 specialized performance tests** marked with `#[ignore]`
- **Release mode required** for accurate measurements
- **Comprehensive benchmarking**: Stress testing, concurrent load, scaling validation
- **Manual/Scheduled execution** to prevent CI blocking

### Test Execution Commands

**Quality Validation (Required for CI/CD):**
```bash
cargo fmt --check                           # Code formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Zero warnings
cargo check --workspace --all-targets       # Compilation check  
cargo test --workspace                      # All quality tests
```

**Performance Validation (Comprehensive):**
```bash
cargo test --release -- --ignored          # All performance tests
cargo test --package bingo-core --test scaling_validation_test --release  # Scaling
```

### Benefits of Separation
- **Fast CI/CD**: Quality checks complete in seconds, not minutes
- **Zero Blocking**: Performance tests don't prevent code integration
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Full enterprise validation available when needed
- **Resource Efficiency**: CI environments only run appropriate test scale
