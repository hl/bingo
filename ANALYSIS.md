    A["üåê bingo-api<br/>HTTP API + OpenAPI<br/>Enterprise Features"] --> B["‚öôÔ∏è bingo-core<br/>RETE Engine + Memory<br/>Fact Stores + Types"]
    B --> C["üßÆ bingo-calculator<br/>Business Logic<br/>Expression Evaluation"]
    D["üìã bingo-prelude<br/>Convenience Re-exports"] --> B
    D --> C
```

- **`bingo-api`** (5,847 lines): REST API, caching, security, operational hardening
- **`bingo-core`** (extensive): RETE network, fact storage, type system, engine logic
- **`bingo-calculator`** (focused): Calculator traits and business logic implementations
- **`bingo-prelude`** (minimal): Convenience re-exports for external usage

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Stateless API Design**: Enables unlimited horizontal scaling
2. **Multi-Level Caching**: Ruleset ‚Üí Engine Template ‚Üí Calculator Results
3. **Arena-Based Memory Management**: Efficient fact storage and lifecycle management
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible calculator system with registry pattern

### Evidence of BSSN Principles
The codebase shows clear evidence of following "Best Simple System for Now":
- Complex features removed when not immediately needed
- Clear separation between current needs vs. future speculation
- Appropriate abstractions without over-engineering
- Focus on production readiness over theoretical flexibility

## Technical Debt Identified

### High Priority (Maintainability)

#### TD-1: Large Module Files
**Issue**: `bingo-api/src/lib.rs` contains 5,847 lines, indicating module organization opportunities.

**Impact**: Reduces code navigability and maintainability
**Effort**: Medium
**Recommendation**: Break into focused modules (handlers, middleware, cache, security)

#### TD-2: Type Conversion Complexity  
**Issue**: Complex conversion layer between API types and core types with bidirectional mappings.

**Location**: `crates/bingo-api/src/types.rs`, `crates/bingo-core/src/types.rs`
**Impact**: Maintenance overhead and potential for conversion errors
**Effort**: Medium
**Recommendation**: Consolidate type definitions or simplify conversion patterns

#### TD-3: FactValue Duplication
**Issue**: `FactValue` enum duplicated between `bingo-core` and `bingo-calculator` crates.

**Impact**: Code duplication, potential for divergence
**Effort**: Low-Medium  
**Recommendation**: Consolidate into shared type in `bingo-core`

### Medium Priority (Optimization)

#### TD-4: Configuration Complexity
**Issue**: Extensive configuration options that may be premature optimization.

**Location**: `crates/bingo-api/src/config.rs`
**Impact**: Increased complexity without clear current benefit
**Effort**: Low
**Recommendation**: Review if all configuration options are needed now

#### TD-5: Over-Abstraction in Calculator System
**Issue**: Calculator trait system may be more complex than current needs require.

**Impact**: Cognitive overhead for simple use cases
**Effort**: Low
**Recommendation**: Evaluate if simpler function-based approach would suffice

### Low Priority (Polish)

#### TD-6: Documentation Organization
**Issue**: Some documentation scattered across multiple locations.

**Effort**: Low
**Recommendation**: Consolidate related documentation in docs/ directory
