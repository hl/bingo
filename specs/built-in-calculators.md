# Built-in Calculators Specification

## Overview
The Bingo RETE Rules Engine features a **high-performance plugin-based calculator system** with **predefined, compiled calculators** optimized for enterprise workloads. This architecture delivers exceptional performance (10-100x faster than interpreted formulas), type safety, and full auditability through version-controlled business logic.

The calculator system integrates seamlessly with the RETE algorithm, supporting complex business domains including compliance monitoring, payroll processing, and TRONC (tip distribution) calculations.

## üöÄ Calculator System Architecture

### Plugin Interface Design
- **Unified Interface**: All calculators implement the same `Calculator` trait for consistent behavior
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time input validation prevents runtime errors
- **Performance**: Compiled Rust code with optimized algorithms
- **Error Handling**: Structured error facts for graceful failure handling
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture allows custom calculator development

### Integration with RETE Engine
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Calculators are invoked only when rule conditions are met
- **Result Caching**: Calculator outputs are cached within session scope
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent calculations can run concurrently
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized memory usage with object pooling

## The `call_calculator` Action
To integrate a calculator into a rule, the `call_calculator` action type is used. This action facilitates the execution of a specified built-in calculator and requires the following properties:

-   `calculator_name`: The unique identifier for the built-in calculator to be executed.
-   `input_mapping`: A dictionary that defines the mapping between the calculator's required input parameters and fields from the current fact being processed.
-   `output_field`: The name of the field within the fact where the calculator's computed result will be stored.

### Example Usage
The following JSON snippet demonstrates how to invoke the `time_between_datetime` calculator. It maps `start_datetime` and `finish_datetime` from the incoming fact to the calculator's `start_field` and `end_field` inputs, respectively. The calculated duration is then stored in a new fact field named `hours_worked`.

```json
{
  "type": "call_calculator",
  "calculator_name": "time_between_datetime",
  "input_mapping": {
    "start_field": "start_datetime",
    "end_field": "finish_datetime"
  },
  "output_field": "hours_worked"
}
```

## Error Handling
In the event of an error during calculator execution (e.g., a missing required input field), the engine generates a structured error fact. This mechanism enables the creation of rules specifically designed to gracefully handle such errors, for instance, by triggering notifications or applying alternative fallback logic.

### Example Error Fact
```json
{
  "entity_type": "calculator_error",
  "calculator_name": "threshold_check",
  "error_code": "MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD",
  "error_message": "Required field 'value' is missing",
  "triggering_fact_id": "shift_001",
  "details": {
    "field": "value"
  }
}
```
