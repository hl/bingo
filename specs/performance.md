# Performance Specification

This document outlines the high-level performance characteristics and optimization strategies of the Bingo Rules Engine. For detailed, up-to-date benchmark results and instructions on running the performance test suite, please refer to the [Performance Test Suite Documentation](../docs/performance-tests.md).

## Memory Management & Optimization

-   **Arena-based `FactStore`**: The default fact store uses an arena allocator (`bumpalo`) for extremely fast, contiguous memory allocation of facts, minimizing pointer chasing and improving cache locality.
-   **Object Pooling**: To combat allocation overhead in a high-throughput environment, the engine maintains pools for:
    -   `HashMap`s used for calculator inputs.
    -   `Vec<ActionResult>` used to store rule execution results.
-   **Result Caching**: A dedicated `CalculatorResultCache` stores the outcomes of calculator function calls, providing significant speedups when the same calculations are repeated.
-   **Compiled Rule Cache**: The API layer maintains a cache of compiled `ReteNetwork` instances. This is the most significant optimization for production workloads, as it avoids the cost of parsing and building the rule network on every request for static rule sets.
-   **Streaming API**: For very large result sets, the API can stream responses as NDJSON, keeping memory usage low and constant regardless of the number of rule firings.

## Performance Benchmarks

The Bingo RETE engine has been extensively tested with real-world scenarios to validate production readiness. All benchmarks are conducted in release mode with individual test execution for accurate measurements.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Linear scaling**: Performance scales predictably with data size
- **Memory efficiency**: ~1.3KB per fact average memory overhead
- **Rule complexity impact**: More rules reduce throughput but remain efficient
- **Enterprise-ready**: 2M facts + 500 rules processed in 2.6 seconds
- **Consistent throughput**: 750K-1.9M facts/second depending on rule complexity
- **Multi-core optimization**: Automatically utilizes all available CPU cores
- **Parallel scalability**: 3-12x throughput improvement on multi-core systems

### Production Targets (All Achieved)

- **100K facts**: <3 seconds ✅ (69ms achieved)
- **200K facts**: <6 seconds ✅ (118ms achieved)
- **500K facts**: <10 seconds ✅ (264ms achieved)
- **1M facts**: <30 seconds ✅ (709ms achieved)
- **2M facts**: <60 seconds ✅ (1.8s achieved)
- **Memory efficiency**: <3GB for 1M facts ✅ (1.3GB achieved)
- **Complex rule sets**: 500+ rules per dataset ✅ (500 rules tested)

### Memory Usage Notes

- Measurements are from individual test runs (not batch execution)
- Memory usage includes fact storage, rule network, and intermediate results
- Enterprise scenarios with complex rules show ~1.2-1.8 output ratio
- Memory efficiency improves at larger scales due to better amortization
