# Bingo RETE Rules Engine

Bingo is a production-ready, high-performance RETE rules engine built in Rust (2024 edition). It implements a complete RETE algorithm with advanced optimizations including rule reordering, parallel processing, conflict resolution, and dependency analysis using Kahn's topological sorting algorithm. The engine is designed for enterprise workloads with O(Δfacts) complexity, processing only incremental changes rather than re-evaluating all facts.

## 🧠 RETE Algorithm Implementation

Bingo implements a complete, optimized RETE algorithm with the following key components:

- **Alpha Memory Network**: O(1) single-condition fact indexing with hash-based pattern matching
- **Beta Memory Network**: Multi-condition rule processing with token propagation and join operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Priority-based rule execution with configurable strategies (Priority, Salience, Specificity, Lexicographic)
- **Rule Optimization**: Automatic condition reordering based on selectivity and cost analysis
- **Dependency Analysis**: Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting of rule execution order
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded RETE processing with work-stealing queues
- **Incremental Processing**: O(Δfacts) complexity - only processes new/changed facts

The engine powers multiple business domains simultaneously, including **Compliance, Payroll, and TRONC (tip distribution)**, through a unified and extensible architecture.

## 🏆 Performance Highlights

The engine is optimized for practical enterprise workloads. The following benchmarks represent realistic performance characteristics based on actual test runs.

- **Beta network**: Proper multi-condition rule processing with token propagation
- **Working memory**: Incremental fact lifecycle management
- **True RETE**: Transforms O(facts×rules) to O(matching_conditions)

### Enterprise Scale Validation (Individual Test Results)

- **100K facts**: 54ms processing time (1.9M facts/sec achieved)
- **250K facts**: 138ms processing time (1.8M facts/sec achieved) - Memory: 305MB
- **1M facts**: 540ms processing time (1.9M facts/sec achieved) - Memory: 1.2GB  
- **2M facts**: 1.4s processing time (1.4M facts/sec achieved) - Memory: 3.2GB
- **Memory efficiency**: Linear scaling ~1.6GB per 1M facts
- **Rule complexity**: Supports 500+ business rules per dataset

*Performance varies significantly with rule complexity and fact relationships. See [Performance Tests Documentation](docs/performance-tests.md) for detailed benchmarks.*

## 💡 Business Engine Capabilities

Bingo's flexible architecture and powerful calculator ecosystem enable sophisticated logic for various business domains.

- **Compliance Engine**:
  - Monitor complex rules, such as weekly work hour limits for student visa holders.
  - Use the `limit_validator` for multi-tiered threshold checks (e.g., warning, critical, breach).
- **Payroll & TRONC (Tip & Gratuity) Engine**:
  - Dynamically create new facts, such as generating overtime records when thresholds are exceeded.
  - Perform complex aggregations to calculate total hours worked before applying overtime rules.
- **TRONC (Tip & Gratuity) Engine**:
  - Distribute gratuities using weighted calculations based on employee roles (`weighted_sum_aggregator`).
  - Allocate funds proportionally based on hours worked or other metrics (`proportional_allocator`).
  - Apply deductions before distribution using the `deduct_percentage` calculator.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns across a multi-crate workspace.
